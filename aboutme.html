 <p>I was born in Monrovia Liberia.
 Most people don't know this about me because I don't tell anyone.
 I moved here at 5 years old. 
 I've lived in Oakland most of my life.
 At first, I lived in west oakland then I moved to East Oakland in the second grade.
I'm an only child from my mother's side but, I have 6 other siblings on my father's side
and I'm the youngest.
When I'm older I'd like to be a CEO of a company I jusst don't know what company. 
I love to travel a lot. 
I've been to Paris, Liberia, Georgia, Texas, and Nevada.
